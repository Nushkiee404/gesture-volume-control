\## 🧠 Overview

\- Cleaned and analyzed temporal disaster data from Kaggle’s M5 or similar forecasting dataset  

\- Extracted key features like event frequency, region type, and damage levels  

\- Built a \*\*LightGBM regression model\*\* for predicting disaster severity and resource demand  

\- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize regional patterns
