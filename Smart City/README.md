\# 🌆 Smart City Energy Demand Prediction



This project forecasts \*\*city energy consumption\*\* for sustainable infrastructure planning using machine learning regression models.



\## 🧠 Overview

\- Cleaned and visualized energy usage data from multiple urban districts  

\- Built regression models to predict short-term and long-term demand  

\- Compared algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  

\- Identified weather and population density as key predictive factors  



\## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | XGBoost | Matplotlib | Seaborn



\## 📊 Results

\- Achieved strong R² and low RMSE on validation data  

\- Built interactive plots for energy consumption trends
