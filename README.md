# ✋ Hand Gesture Volume Control 🎛️

A real-time **Computer Vision** project that controls your system volume using **hand gestures** detected through your webcam.  
Built with **Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe**, this project blends AI and human-computer interaction in a fun and intuitive way.

## 🧠 Features
- ✋ Detects hand landmarks using **Mediapipe**
- 🔊 Controls system volume using **thumb–index finger distance**
- ⚡ Real-time performance (~30 FPS)
- 🧩 Customizable gestures for brightness or other actions
- 💻 Easy to set up and run locally

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
| Category | Tools / Libraries |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Language** | Python |
| **Computer Vision** | OpenCV |
| **Hand Tracking** | Mediapipe |
| **Audio Control** | Pycaw |
| **Environment** | Jupyter / VS Code |

## 🧩 How It Works
1. The webcam feed is processed frame by frame using **OpenCV**
2. **Mediapipe** detects the position of hand landmarks
3. The distance between **thumb and index finger** is mapped to a **volume percentage**
4. The system volume dynamically adjusts in real time
